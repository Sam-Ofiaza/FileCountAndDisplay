Project was imported and originally made for CS 3377 (Systems Programming in UNIX and Other Environments) with Professor Nhut Nguyen.

Thoughts: This was originally made for the command line in a Linux emulator for Windows (Linux Mint). Won't work in CLion because certain libraries in UNIX aren't recognized. 
The commands 'filecnt' and 'filedisp' are supposed to be used in a pipe to find information about the files in a given directory. Includes recursive traversal through the 
directory to access all files and count the number of files, directories, and bytes the whole directory contains. Use of options with filedisp shows one of the three. Overall the 
project was easy because I'd already done the hard part in a previous assignment in the same class.
